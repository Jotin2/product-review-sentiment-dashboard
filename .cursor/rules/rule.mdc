Frontend (React + Tailwind)

Use functional components only.

Use Tailwind CSS exclusively for styling; no additional CSS files unless explicitly requested.

Keep components modular and reusable.

Organize files in the following folders:

components/ → UI elements

pages/ → main views/screens

services/ → API calls (Axios)

context/ → React Context for global state

hooks/ → custom hooks

Components must have placeholder text when actual logic is not implemented.

Layout should be responsive by default using Tailwind classes.

Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

Follow the MERN stack architecture.

Use RESTful API conventions.

Separate files for models/, routes/, controllers/.

Middleware should be modular and reusable.

Placeholder endpoints should return simple JSON responses when logic isn’t implemented.

General Project Rules

Always respect the existing folder structure and naming conventions.

Avoid breaking existing functionality when adding new code.

When creating new features, keep them consistent with previous patterns.

Do not hardcode environment variables; always use .env files.

Document placeholder behavior clearly in code comments.

For new tasks, ask if the implementation should be placeholder or real logic.
